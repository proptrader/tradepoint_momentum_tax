# Stock Portfolio Management System with Tax Calculations

## Background and Motivation
We need to build a system that manages a portfolio of stocks, tracks trades, calculates profit and loss, and applies tax calculations based on whether trades are short-term or long-term. The system needs to maintain a corpus of available funds, which gets distributed among stocks as they enter the portfolio. When stocks exit, their value (plus or minus profit/loss) returns to the corpus, with appropriate tax considerations.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Data Processing**: Read and parse CSV input files containing trade data, stopping at the first blank line.
2. **Date-based Trade Ordering**: Process trades chronologically, handling exits before entries on the same date.
3. **Fund Allocation**: Manage the available corpus, tracking investments in each stock.
4. **Tax Calculation**: Implement a complex tax calculation logic based on short-term vs long-term trades, losses, and profits.
5. **Portfolio Tracking**: Track the portfolio composition over time.
6. **Configuration Management**: Read X (initial capital) and N (max stocks) from a configuration file with defaults.
7. **Error Handling**: Flag errors for invalid scenarios like having more than N stocks.

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. **Project Setup**
   - Create a basic directory structure (input, output folders)
   - Set up the main application file
   - Create configuration file structure with defaults (X=2,000,000, N=20)
   - Define data models and classes
   - Success criteria: Directory structure created and basic application skeleton in place

2. **Input Data Processing**
   - Implement CSV parsing
   - Extract relevant columns (stock name, entry price, exit price, entry date, exit date)
   - Implement logic to stop reading at the first blank line
   - Sort trades by date for proper processing
   - Handle date format (DD-MMM-YY)
   - Success criteria: Ability to correctly parse input files and organize trade data chronologically

3. **Portfolio Management Logic**
   - Implement logic to track available corpus
   - Calculate stock quantities based on allocated funds
   - Track investment amount per stock
   - Success criteria: Correctly calculate portfolio allocation and track investments

4. **Trade Processing Logic**
   - Implement exit processing logic
   - Implement entry processing logic
   - Ensure exits are processed before entries on the same date
   - Success criteria: Trades are processed in the correct order with appropriate corpus updates

5. **Profit/Loss and Tax Calculation**
   - Identify short-term vs long-term trades
   - Calculate raw profit/loss for each trade
   - Implement the tax calculation logic based on specifications
   - Success criteria: Correct tax calculations as per the formula provided

6. **Output Generation**
   - Create formatted CSV output with required columns
   - Ensure proper naming convention (tax-{input_filename})
   - Success criteria: Properly formatted output files with all required columns

7. **Monthly Summary Report Generation**
   - Create a function to generate a summary CSV report from the tax output file
   - Implement the report structure with months as columns and years as rows
   - Calculate profit after tax (PNL - Tax) for each month
   - Include yearly totals
   - Use proper naming convention (summary-{input_filename})
   - Success criteria: Correctly formatted summary report showing profit by month and year
   - âœ… Completed: The summary report is now generated as part of the output process

8. **Testing and Validation**
   - Test with sample data
   - Verify calculations match expected outcomes
   - Success criteria: System produces correct results for test cases

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
We have successfully implemented the monthly profit summary feature. The new functionality:
- Generates a CSV file with months as columns and years as rows
- Shows profit after tax (PNL - Tax) for each month/year
- Includes yearly totals
- Uses the correct "summary-" prefix in the filename
- Reads the tax output file as input for summary generation

The implementation has been tested and is working as expected. The code has been updated in:
- src/utils/output_generator.py: Added new functions for summary report generation
- src/main.py: Updated to handle the new output files

Requirements.md has also been updated to include the new feature requirements.

## Lessons
- Include corpus calculations and tax logic in debug output for easier verification
- Round decimal calculations to two places as specified in the requirements
- Ensure quantity calculations always round down to integers
- Configuration values (X=2,000,000, N=20) should be read from a config file with defaults
- Flag errors for invalid scenarios like having more than N stocks
- Stop reading the input file at the first blank line
- Use pandas for efficient data manipulation when generating summary reports
- Make sure all months are present in summary reports even if there's no data for that month
