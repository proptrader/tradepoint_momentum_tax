   - Initialize source files
   - Create requirements.txt

2. **Milestone 2: Data Models** ✓
   - Implement Trade class
   - Implement Portfolio class
   - Implement Corpus management

3. **Milestone 3: Core Logic** ✓
   - Implement data ingestion
   - Implement trade processing
   - Implement tax calculation

4. **Milestone 4: Output and Reporting** ✓
   - Implement output generation
   - Implement monthly profit summary reports
   - Format output files correctly

5. **Milestone 5: Testing and Refinement** (In Progress)
   - Develop comprehensive tests

## Notes for Next Steps

The next focus should be on:
1. Developing comprehensive tests for all components
2. Adding better error handling for edge cases
3. Optimizing performance for large datasets
4. Implementing visualizations for the monthly profit data

We will focus on implementing the core data structures first, then move on to the processing logic.
