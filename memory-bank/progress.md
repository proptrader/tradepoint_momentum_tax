# TradePoint Momentum Tax - Progress

## What Works

As we are in the planning phase, nothing has been implemented yet. We have:

- [x] Created the memory bank structure
- [x] Documented the project requirements
- [x] Designed the system architecture
- [x] Planned the implementation approach
- [x] Created a comprehensive requirements document
- [x] Received and incorporated user clarifications

## What's Left to Build

Everything implementation-related is left to implement:

- [ ] Project structure setup
- [ ] Core data models
- [ ] Data ingestion
- [ ] Trade processing logic
- [ ] Tax calculation
- [ ] Output generation
- [ ] Testing and validation

## Current Status

| Component           | Status      | Progress | Notes                                    |
|---------------------|-------------|----------|------------------------------------------|
| Requirements Doc    | Complete    | 100%     | Comprehensive requirements created       |
| Project Structure   | Not Started | 0%       | Need to create directories and base files |
| Core Data Models    | Not Started | 0%       | Need to define classes                   |
| Data Ingestion      | Not Started | 0%       | CSV parsing not yet implemented          |
| Trade Processing    | Not Started | 0%       | Logic for entries/exits not developed    |
| Tax Calculation     | Not Started | 0%       | Tax rules defined but not implemented    |
| Output Generation   | Not Started | 0%       | Format defined but not implemented       |
| Testing             | Not Started | 0%       | Test cases to be developed               |

## Known Issues

N/A - No implementation yet.

## Implementation Milestones

1. **Milestone 1: Basic Structure**
   - Create project directories (input, output)
   - Set up configuration file structure
   - Initialize source files
   - Create requirements.txt

2. **Milestone 2: Data Models**
   - Implement Trade class
   - Implement Portfolio class
   - Implement Corpus management

3. **Milestone 3: Core Logic**
   - Implement data ingestion
   - Implement trade processing
   - Implement tax calculation

4. **Milestone 4: Output and Testing**
   - Implement output generation
   - Develop comprehensive tests
   - Verify with sample data

## Notes for Next Steps

Once we receive approval to proceed with coding, we'll start with:
1. Creating the necessary directories
2. Setting up a configuration file system
3. Implementing initial data models
4. Writing basic tests

We will focus on implementing the core data structures first, then move on to the processing logic.
