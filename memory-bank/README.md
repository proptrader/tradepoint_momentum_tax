- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies

## Purpose

The memory bank is designed to:
- Store and retrieve historical trading data
- Maintain state between application runs
- Provide efficient data access patterns
- Ensure data persistence and reliability

## Usage

The memory bank can be imported and used in other parts of the application to store and retrieve data. See the implementation in `memory_bank.py` for detailed usage examples.
